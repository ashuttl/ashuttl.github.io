#### I&rsquo;m Andrew Shuttleworth. I&rsquo;ve worked as a writer, graphic designer, web developer, and arts marketer. I used to live in Maine and now I live in Brooklyn, New York.

I&rsquo;m the Director of Digital Marketing Services for&nbsp;[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts](http://lc.lincolncenter.org). I also occasionally freelance as a copywriter and graphic designer.

Before Lincoln Center, I worked as a technology and marketing consultant for [Blackbaud](http://blackbaud.com/) and its clients, as a marketer and graphic designer for what&rsquo;s now called [Portland Ovations](http://portlandovations.org) (it was [PCA Great Performances](http://ashuttleworth.com/pca/) in my day), as a graphic designer at a small agency, and, a long time ago, as a bartender.

You can reach me by tweeting to [@ashuttl](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=ashuttl) or by sending an email to [hello@ashut.tl](mailto:hello@ashut.tl). I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.
