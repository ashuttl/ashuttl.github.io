<p>With iOS 6, the loss of Google Maps&rsquo; excellent transit directions, and Apple&rsquo;s half-baked, car-centric replacement, the iPhone got a whole lot less useful to New Yorkers this past week. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;us&#47;app&#47;embark-nyc-subway-new-york&#47;id450991137?mt=8"><strong>Embark NYC<&#47;strong><&#47;a> is a free app for subway directions that works brilliantly and looks great, echoing Vignelli&rsquo;s signage throughout. It&rsquo;s even smart enough that, if you ask for station-to-station directions, and you&rsquo;d be better off walking to a different departure station, it will tell you.<&#47;p></p>
<p>As much of a pleasure as it is to use, Embark NYC is only for subways, though. If you want buses, commuter rail, or an app that works with several North American systems, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;itunes.apple.com&#47;us&#47;app&#47;the-transit-app&#47;id498151501?mt=8"><strong>The Transit App<&#47;strong><&#47;a> might also be work checking out. A handy feature: it can tell you which buses near you are going to arrive and when.<&#47;p></p>
