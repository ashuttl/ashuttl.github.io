<h4>I&rsquo;m Andrew Shuttleworth. I&rsquo;ve worked as a writer, graphic designer, web developer, and arts marketer. I used to live in Maine and now I live in Brooklyn, New York.<&#47;h4><br />
I&rsquo;m the Director of Digital Marketing Services for&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;lc.lincolncenter.org">Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts<&#47;a>. I also occasionally freelance as a copywriter and graphic designer.</p>
<p>Before Lincoln Center, I worked as a technology and marketing consultant for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blackbaud.com&#47;">Blackbaud<&#47;a> and its clients, as a marketer and graphic designer for what&rsquo;s now called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;portlandovations.org">Portland Ovations<&#47;a> (it was <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ashuttleworth.com&#47;pca&#47;">PCA Great Performances<&#47;a> in my day), as a graphic designer at a small agency, and, a long time ago, as a bartender.</p>
<p>You can reach me by tweeting to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;intent&#47;tweet?screen_name=ashuttl">@ashuttl<&#47;a> or by sending an email to <a href="mailto:hello@ashut.tl">hello@ashut.tl<&#47;a>. I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>
