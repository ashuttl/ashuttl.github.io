<p>What I did this weekend:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever been to the Fair, you know &ndash; and if you haven&rsquo;t been, anyone who has will tell you &ndash; it&rsquo;s an event like no other, that brings so many people from so many walks of life, all in the spirit of celebrating the rural and agricultural traditions of Maine.<&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>There should be a word for patriotism for one&rsquo;s home state. I&rsquo;m full of it tonight.<&#47;p></p>
