Today I stumbled across a document called “[Toponymic Guidelines for Map and Other Editors &ndash; Estonia](http://www.eki.ee/knn/ungegn/un7_gdl.htm),” and spent an unduly long time reading it.[^1]

I think it fascinates me because it reminds me a bit of J.R.R. Tolkien’s descriptions of the etymology and place-names of Middle-Earth, except that Estonia actually exists. I am also delighted beyond reason that there exists something called the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographic Names, let alone that there have apparently been _seven_ such conferences.

[^1]: In my defense, I was actually doing work, trying to figure out how to correctly pronounce the name of the Estonian conductor T&otilde;nu Kaljuste for the benefit of WQXR’s announcers. (Still no definitive answer.)
