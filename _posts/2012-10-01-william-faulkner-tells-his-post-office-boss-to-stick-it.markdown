<p>Back before William Faulkner was <em>the William Faulkner, he was a clerk in the post office at the University of Mississippi, where, by all accounts, he was a terrible employee. When a postal inspector came to check up on him, he chafed, promptly resigning in this terse letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>October, 1924</p>
<p>As long as I live under the capitalistic system, I expect to have my life influenced by the demands of moneyed people. But I will be damned if I propose to be at the beck and call of every itinerant scoundrel who has two cents to invest in a postage stamp.</p>
<p>This, sir, is my resignation.</p>
<p>William Faulkner<br />
</p>
<p>He was the same age that I am now. I love this so much. (Via <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;intent&#47;user?screen_name=openculture">@openculture.)</p>
