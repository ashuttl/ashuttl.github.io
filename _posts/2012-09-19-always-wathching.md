Spotted this morning along Broadway just north of Columbus Circle:

My first guess was that it was an ad for some new libertarian talk radio station, but it turns out WATH is in Athens, Ohio, and that would probably have been a little too subtle, anyway. My secret hope is that the extra h in wathching is an accident.


**Update:** Apparently [the NYPD](http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/09/nypd-investigating-fake-propaganda-poster.html) is on the case.
