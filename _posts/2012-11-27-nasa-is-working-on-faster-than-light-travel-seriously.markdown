<blockquote>
A few months ago, physicist Harold White stunned the aeronautics world when he announced that he and his team at NASA had begun work on the development of a faster-than-light warp drive. His proposed design, an ingenious re-imagining of an Alcubierre Drive, may eventually result in an engine that can transport a spacecraft to the nearest star in a matter of weeks &ndash; and all without violating Einstein&rsquo;s law of relativity.<br />

<p>I think I read this article five times today. It blows my mind.</p>
<p>What really gets me: It now looks entirely plausible &ndash; even likely &ndash; that one day, people will smirk at how we thought this faster-than-light business was impossible. <em>Einsteinian might never sound as derisive as <em>Lamarckian does to us today, but you never know.</p>
