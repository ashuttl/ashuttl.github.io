Seth Godin advises:

> Now that information is ubiquitous, the obligation changes. It’s no longer okay to not know.
> 
If you don’t know what a word means, look it up.
> 
> If you’re meeting with someone, check them out in advance.
> 
> If it sounds too good to be true, Google it before you forward it.

I might add:

If you don’t know the name of the product, look at the manufacturer’s website.

(Hint: Adobe makes no application called “PhotoShop” and Apple has never produced anything called an “iTouch.”)
