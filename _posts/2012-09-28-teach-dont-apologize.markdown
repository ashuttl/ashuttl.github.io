<p>Christopher Mims, in a piece for Quartz headlined &ldquo;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;qz.com&#47;9440&#47;why-steve-jobs-wouldnt-have-apologized-for-maps-and-tim-cook-shouldnt-have-either&#47;">Why Steve Jobs wouldn&rsquo;t have apologized for Apple Maps, and Tim Cook shouldn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; has a very different take than mine on Tim Cook&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>If Jobs were alive today, Apple would probably have remained silent on the maps issue or held a similar press conference &ndash; and one very different in tone from Cook&rsquo;s letter. Jobs would have explained to the public that mapping is a uniquely difficult problem, and that the only way to build your own maps database from the ground up &ndash; one that could ultimately lead to a product superior to, or at least usefully different from Google maps &ndash; is to put it out in the wild and have millions of real users test it.</p>
<p>I like to imagine a world in which this corporate-communications tactic would have worked. Trying to get the general public on your side by educating them about something is a very, very difficult thing to do. Ask Al Gore. Figure out how to teach people about something they don&rsquo;t want to understand and you&rsquo;ll save the world.</p>
