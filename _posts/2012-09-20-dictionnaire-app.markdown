<p>I just updated my MacBook Air to Mac OS X 10.8.2, and got a delightful surprise in the release notes: Dictionary.app now includes a French dictionary. To activate it, open the Dictionary app, go to Dictionary > Preferences, and check &ldquo;<em>Multidictionnaire de la langue fran&ccedil;aise<&#47;em>.&rdquo; Once you&rsquo;ve added it there, French will show up as an option in the dictionary Dashboard widget, too.<&#47;p></p>
<p>The dictionary&rsquo;s copyright holder, Canadian publisher Les &Eacute;ditions Qu&eacute;bec Am&eacute;rique Inc., made me wonder whether Apple had chosen a dictionary of Canadian French without realizing it was different from Metropolitan French, so I spot-checked some words that are different in the two dialects. In fact, I found, it&rsquo;s a pretty good dictionary of international French. Some indicative highlights:<&#47;p></p>
<ul>
<li>The Anglicism <strong><em>job<&#47;em><&#47;strong> is marked as masculine, although in informal Qu&eacute;b&eacute;c usage it is usually considered feminine. (Q.V. <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;La_Job">this<&#47;a>.)<&#47;li>
<li><strong><em>Autobus<&#47;em><&#47;strong> is marked as masculine, although in Metropolitan usage it is usually considered feminine.<&#47;li>
<li><strong><em>Placoter<&#47;em><&#47;strong>, meaning &ldquo;to chit-chat,&rdquo; and <strong><em>abrier<&#47;em><&#47;strong>, for &ldquo;to cover,&rdquo; are both marked quite accurately with the note &ldquo;Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cisme.&rdquo;<&#47;li>
<li><strong><em>Amancher<&#47;em><&#47;strong>, an old word for &ldquo;to assemble&rdquo; or &ldquo;to fix&rdquo; that&rsquo;s now rarely heard outside of Qu&eacute;bec, isn&rsquo;t defined at all.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>An interesting lexicographical note: French spelling and pronunciation is so regularized that the dictionary doesn&rsquo;t bother including pronunciations, except for occasional sentence-length explanations on the rare words that aren&rsquo;t pronounced according to the usual rules. For <em>femme<&#47;em>, for example, it notes &ldquo;<em>La premi&egrave;re syllable se prononce<&#47;em> <strong>fa<&#47;strong> [fam] <em>; le nom rime avec<&#47;em> <strong>dame<&#47;strong>.&rdquo; It also specifically notes that shampooing (which is by the way a noun for the stuff, not a verb for the act) is not pronounced like the English: &ldquo;<em>Les lettres<&#47;em> <strong>oing<&#47;strong> <em>se prononcent<&#47;em> <strong>oin<&#47;strong><em>,<&#47;em> [ʃɑ̃pwɛ̃]<em> (et non *ou).&rdquo;<&#47;em><&#47;p></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love it if this dictionary included <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cnrtl.fr&#47;etymologie&#47;abandon">etymological notes like these<&#47;a>, but even without them, this seems so far to be a solid dictionary and a very nice improvement to Mac OS X.<&#47;p></p>
