What I did this weekend:

> If you’ve ever been to the Fair, you know &ndash; and if you haven’t been, anyone who has will tell you &ndash; it’s an event like no other, that brings so many people from so many walks of life, all in the spirit of celebrating the rural and agricultural traditions of Maine.

There should be a word for patriotism for one’s home state. I’m full of it tonight.
