<p><em>Rain Room<&#47;em>, the newest work by digital art collective Random International, consists of an indoor space in which it rains continuously everywhere except the very spot you&rsquo;re standing. The raindrops, controlled by computers, just barely miss you.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.fastcodesign.com&#47;1670950&#47;a-room-where-you-can-walk-in-the-rain-but-stay-dry">this great photo gallery on Co.Design<&#47;a>. It&rsquo;s on now through March 3 at the Barbican, Lincoln Center&rsquo;s English counterpart. I&rsquo;m dying to see it.</p>
