<p>Pasta is a rich source of colorful Italian loan words. Orin Hargraves, on the blog of the Macmillan Dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take <em>campanelle, for instance. These cone-shaped pasta shapes with a frilly edge look a little like a bell and a little like a flower. In fact they look like a bellflower, which in English is also called <em>campanula. The word in Italian means &ldquo;little bells.&rdquo; The Latin ancestor of <em>campanelle also gives us <em>campanology (the art of bell-ringing), and <em>campanile (a bell tower).<br />
</p>
<p>Love the little quiz at the end. It&rsquo;s connections like the one between <em>linguine and <em>linguist (the root word <em>lingua, meaning &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;) that make me want to run off and be an etymologist.</p>
