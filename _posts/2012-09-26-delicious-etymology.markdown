<p>Pasta is a rich source of colorful Italian loan words. Orin Hargraves, on the blog of the Macmillan Dictionary:<&#47;p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take <em>campanelle<&#47;em>, for instance. These cone-shaped pasta shapes with a frilly edge look a little like a bell and a little like a flower. In fact they look like a bellflower, which in English is also called <em>campanula<&#47;em>. The word in Italian means &ldquo;little bells.&rdquo; The Latin ancestor of <em>campanelle<&#47;em> also gives us <em>campanology<&#47;em> (the art of bell-ringing), and <em>campanile<&#47;em> (a bell tower).<&#47;p><br />
<&#47;blockquote></p>
<p>Love the little quiz at the end. It&rsquo;s connections like the one between <em>linguine<&#47;em> and <em>linguist<&#47;em> (the root word <em>lingua<&#47;em>, meaning &ldquo;tongue&rdquo;) that make me want to run off and be an etymologist.<&#47;p></p>
