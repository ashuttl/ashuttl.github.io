<p>This is the way to handle public-relations disasters. In particular, this customer-oriented paragraph, which suggests customers use alternatives from three of Apple&rsquo;s biggest competitors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we&rsquo;re improving Maps, you can try alternatives by downloading map apps from the App Store like Bing, MapQuest and Waze, or use Google or Nokia maps by going to their websites and creating an icon on your home screen to their web apps.<br />
</p>
<p>Now they have to actually fix the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Although Neven Mrgan makes an excellent point on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>The trickiest part of Apple&#8217;s challenge with Maps: getting users to eventually believe that &#8220;ok NOW it&#8217;s fixed.&#8221;&mdash; Neven Mrgan (@mrgan) <a href="https:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;mrgan&#47;status&#47;251690961728585729" data-datetime="2012-09-28T14:32:56+00:00">September 28, 2012<br />
