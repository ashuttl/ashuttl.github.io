<p>Today I stumbled across a document called &ldquo;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.eki.ee&#47;knn&#47;ungegn&#47;un7_gdl.htm">Toponymic Guidelines for Map and Other Editors &ndash; Estonia,&rdquo; and spent an unduly long time reading it.<sup>1</p>
<p>I think it fascinates me because it reminds me a bit of J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s descriptions of the etymology and place-names of Middle-Earth, except that Estonia actually exists. I am also delighted beyond reason that there exists something called the United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographic Names, let alone that there have apparently been <em>seven such conferences.</p>

<li>In my defense, I was actually doing work, trying to figure out how to correctly pronounce the name of the Estonian conductor T&otilde;nu Kaljuste for the benefit of WQXR&rsquo;s announcers. (Still no definitive answer.)<br />
