I just updated my MacBook Air to Mac OS X 10.8.2, and got a delightful surprise in the release notes: Dictionary.app now includes a French dictionary. To activate it, open the Dictionary app, go to Dictionary > Preferences, and check “<em>Multidictionnaire de la langue fran&ccedil;aise.” Once you’ve added it there, French will show up as an option in the dictionary Dashboard widget, too.

The dictionary’s copyright holder, Canadian publisher Les &Eacute;ditions Qu&eacute;bec Am&eacute;rique Inc., made me wonder whether Apple had chosen a dictionary of Canadian French without realizing it was different from Metropolitan French, so I spot-checked some words that are different in the two dialects. In fact, I found, it’s a pretty good dictionary of international French. Some indicative highlights:

* The Anglicism _job_ is marked as masculine, although in informal Qu&eacute;b&eacute;c usage it is usually considered feminine. (Q.V. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Job">this</a>.)
* _Autobus_ is marked as masculine, although in Metropolitan usage it is usually considered feminine.
* _Placoter_, meaning “to chit-chat,” and _abrier_, for “to cover,” are both marked quite accurately with the note “Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cisme.”
* _Amancher_, an old word for “to assemble” or “to fix” that’s now rarely heard outside of Qu&eacute;bec, isn’t defined at all.

An interesting lexicographical note: French spelling and pronunciation is so regularized that the dictionary doesn’t bother including pronunciations, except for occasional sentence-length explanations on the rare words that aren’t pronounced according to the usual rules. For _femme_, for example, it notes “La premi&egrave;re syllable se prononce fa [fam]; le nom rime avec _dame_.”

It also specifically notes that shampooing (which is by the way a noun for the stuff, not a verb for the act) is not pronounced like the English: “Les lettres **oing** se prononcent **oin**, [ʃɑ̃pwɛ̃] (et non *ou).”

I’d love it if this dictionary included [etymological](http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/abandon) notes like these, but even without them, this seems so far to be a solid dictionary and a very nice improvement to Mac OS X.
