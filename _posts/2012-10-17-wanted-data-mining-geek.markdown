<p>We&rsquo;re hiring for a brand-new position at Lincoln Center. The title is &ldquo;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;about.lincolncenter.org&#47;about&#47;employment&#47;full-time&#47;">Direct Marketing Manager,&rdquo; but that doesn&rsquo;t really do it justice &ndash; it&rsquo;s primarily a data-mining and business intelligence job. We&rsquo;re looking for an all-around analytical thinker who can be creative about using whatever tools (Access, SQL, R, probably stuff I&rsquo;ve never heard of) are needed to get at the human trends that are really behind the data.</p>
<p>Who buys X performance but not Y performance? Are our performances in discrete groups that tend to be purchased together with little overlap? What does a typical buyer for Z series look like? How many tickets did that brochure sell? Is there any segment of our audience that only buys shows that, say, feature an oboe, or include minor-key works?</p>
<p>It should be a really fun job for the right person. Lots of room to think creatively; not much day-to-day muck to get in the way.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested, send us a note at <a href="mailto:directmarketingmanager@lincolncenter.org">directmarketingmanager@lincolncenter.org.</p>
<p><strong>Update: This position was filled by the extremely capable <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;intent&#47;user?screen_name=mholt3">Michael Ryan Holt.</p>
