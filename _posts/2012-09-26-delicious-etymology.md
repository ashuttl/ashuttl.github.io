Pasta is a rich source of colorful Italian loan words. Orin Hargraves, on the blog of the Macmillan Dictionary:

> Take <em>campanelle, for instance. These cone-shaped pasta shapes with a frilly edge look a little like a bell and a little like a flower. In fact they look like a bellflower, which in English is also called <em>campanula. The word in Italian means “little bells.” The Latin ancestor of <em>campanelle also gives us <em>campanology (the art of bell-ringing), and <em>campanile (a bell tower).

Love the little quiz at the end. It’s connections like the one between _linguine_ and _linguist_ (the root word _lingua_, meaning “tongue”) that make me want to run off and be an etymologist.
