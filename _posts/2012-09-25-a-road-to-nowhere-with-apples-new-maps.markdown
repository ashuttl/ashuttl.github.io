<p>But this time, that first step seems shockingly premature and arrogant, even for Apple. I find it hard to accept that they didn&rsquo;t know how bad their map data is; developers around the world have had access to it for months, and have been filing bug reports. We don&rsquo;t know why they rushed this out, but clearly they haven&rsquo;t committed Google-level resources and time to this technology.<&#47;p><br />

<p>Couldn&rsquo;t agree more. The whole piece is a great read about what might have brought Apple to this point and where they might go from here.<&#47;p></p>
