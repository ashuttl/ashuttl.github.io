<p>Seth Godin advises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now that information is ubiquitous, the obligation changes. It&rsquo;s no longer okay to not know.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what a word means, look it up.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re meeting with someone, check them out in advance.</p>
<p>If it sounds too good to be true, Google it before you forward it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I might add:</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the name of the product, look at the manufacturer&rsquo;s website.</p>
<p>(Hint: Adobe makes no application called &ldquo;PhotoShop&rdquo; and Apple has never produced anything called an &ldquo;iTouch.&rdquo;)</p>
