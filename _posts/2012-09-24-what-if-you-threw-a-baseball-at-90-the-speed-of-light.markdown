<p>Randall Munroe, the creator of the excellent comic strip <a href="http:&#47;&#47;xkcd.com&#47;">XKCD, has started answering fun gee-I-wonder questions using science and math in a new blog called <a href="http:&#47;&#47;what-if.xkcd.com&#47;1&#47;">What If?. Start from the beginning. It&rsquo;s incredibly entertaining and surprisingly educational.</p>
<p>The answer to the&nbsp;question&nbsp;in the headline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything within roughly a mile of the park is leveled, and a firestorm engulfs the surrounding city. The baseball diamond is now a sizable crater, centered a few hundred feet behind the former location of the backstop.<br />
