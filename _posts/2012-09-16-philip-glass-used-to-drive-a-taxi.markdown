<p>According to WNYC&rsquo;s <em>Studio 360, via <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;intent&#47;follow?screen_name=markhokane">Mark Ho-Kane:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1976, Philip Glass was an unknown composer &ndash; almost pushing 40, and driving a taxi to make ends meet &ndash; when he got his break: a new work performed at New York&rsquo;s <em>echt-prestigious Metropolitan Opera House.<br />
</p>
<p><em>Einstein on the Beach was composed by a New York City taxi driver. That completely blows my mind.</p>
<p>Also, as someone who got an early start and then watched as everyone caught up with me, I&rsquo;m always encouraged by those who become wildly successful rather late in life. Maybe there&rsquo;s hope for me to make a comeback.</p>
