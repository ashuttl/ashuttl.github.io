With iOS 6, the loss of Google Maps’ excellent transit directions, and Apple’s half-baked, car-centric replacement, the iPhone got a whole lot less useful to New Yorkers this past week. **[Embark NYC](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/embark-nyc-subway-new-york/id450991137?mt=8)** is a free app for subway directions that works brilliantly and looks great, echoing Vignelli’s signage throughout. It’s even smart enough that, if you ask for station-to-station directions, and you’d be better off walking to a different departure station, it will tell you.

As much of a pleasure as it is to use, Embark NYC is only for subways, though. If you want buses, commuter rail, or an app that works with several North American systems, **[The Transit App](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-transit-app/id498151501?mt=8)** might also be work checking out. A handy feature: it can tell you which buses near you are going to arrive and when.
