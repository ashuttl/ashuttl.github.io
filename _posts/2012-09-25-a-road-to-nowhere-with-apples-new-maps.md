> But this time, that first step seems shockingly premature and arrogant, even for Apple. I find it hard to accept that they didn’t know how bad their map data is; developers around the world have had access to it for months, and have been filing bug reports. We don’t know why they rushed this out, but clearly they haven’t committed Google-level resources and time to this technology.

Couldn’t agree more. The whole piece is a great read about what might have brought Apple to this point and where they might go from here.
