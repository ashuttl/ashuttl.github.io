<p>Spotted this morning along Broadway just north of Columbus Circle:</p>
<p><img title="always-wathching.jpg" src="http:&#47;&#47;ashuttleworth.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2013&#47;06&#47;always-wathching.jpg" alt="Always wathching" width="1000" height="1338" border="0" &#47;></p>
<p>My first guess was that it was an ad for some new libertarian talk radio station, but it turns out WATH is in Athens, Ohio, and that would probably have been a little too subtle, anyway. My secret hope is that the extra h in wathching is an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Update: Apparently <a href="http:&#47;&#47;nymag.com&#47;daily&#47;intel&#47;2012&#47;09&#47;nypd-investigating-fake-propaganda-poster.html">the NYPD is on the case.</p>
