Randall Munroe, the creator of the excellent comic strip [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/), has started answering fun gee-I-wonder questions using science and math in a new blog called [What If?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/1/). Start from the beginning. Itâ€™s incredibly entertaining and surprisingly educational.

The answer to the&nbsp;question&nbsp;in the headline:

>Everything within roughly a mile of the park is leveled, and a firestorm engulfs the surrounding city. The baseball diamond is now a sizable crater, centered a few hundred feet behind the former location of the backstop.
