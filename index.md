Nice to meet you. I&rsquo;m Andrew Shuttleworth.

I&rsquo;ve worked as a writer, graphic designer, web developer, and arts marketer. I used to live in Portland and Ellsworth, Maine. I now live in Brooklyn, New York, where I’m the head of <a href="http://made.media">Made Media</a>’s U.S. operation. We&nbsp;make websites for arts&nbsp;organizations.

Until 2015, I was the Director of Digital Marketing Services for&nbsp;[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts](http://lc.lincolncenter.org), where I also worked as a copywriter and marketing technologist. Before Lincoln&nbsp;Center, I worked as a technology and marketing consultant for [Blackbaud](http://blackbaud.com/) and its clients, as a marketer and graphic designer for what&rsquo;s now called [Portland Ovations](http://portlandovations.org) (it was [PCA Great Performances](http://ashuttleworth.com/pca/) in my day), as a graphic designer at a small agency, and, a long time ago, as a bartender.

You can reach me by tweeting to [@ashuttl](http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=ashuttl) or by sending an email to [ashuttleworth@gmail.com](mailto:ashuttleworth@gmail.com). I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.
