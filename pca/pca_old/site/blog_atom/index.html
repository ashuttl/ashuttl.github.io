        <p>Two of my childhood fascinations were always space travel and PBS nature documentaries. I didn’t realize I had outgrown neither fixation until last night’s <em>Lunar Sea</em> performance by <a href="http://pcagreatperformances.org/2007-08/momix/">Momix</a> combined them into one thing.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../../../../blog/archives/share_your_reactions_to_momix/index.html"><img src="../../../../../images/momix-blog.jpg" width="400" height="218" /></a>
</p>
<p>
The black-lit dancers seemed to give us a tour of an alien landscape, populated with creatures recognizable as life but distinctly unfamiliar. I felt like I was watching extraterrestrial nature on all scales – tidepool critters at one moment, bounding forest fauna at another, and later, shimmering, vibrating diatoms. Once, green-lit dancers seemed to show us a languid afternoon in some lunar palace; later, creatures like feather-lipped clams (or maybe sunflowers?) arranged themselves into something resembling DNA. And at one particularly dazzling moment, as the dancers sent waves through glowing cables stretched across the stage, string theory came to my mind. There was an intimacy and an honesty of movement, despite the distance suggested by the scrim between the dancers and the audience; as though these creatures knew we were there watching them but weren’t really interested in us.
</p><p>There was a lot going on, to be sure.
</p>
<p>
And on a personal note, as PCA’s graphic designer, it was thrilling to see the images I’ve been using for the past year in our advertising come to life on the stage.
</p>
<p>
That’s how the performance struck me. How did it strike you? What did it make you think of? Use the comments feature of this blog to share your thoughts.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and while you’re here, be sure to check out PCA’s interview with the very entertaining Moses Pendleton, the director of Momix and the creator of <em>Lunar Sea.</em> It’s still online at <a href="http://pcagreatperformances.org/2007-08/momix/">our Momix page</a> (rightmost column, down at the bottom). There’s also a video clip on that page of the first piece from <em>Lunar Sea,</em> if you want something to show your friends who missed it.

        <p>I’m back from NYC!&nbsp; It was quite a week, which I had the very good fortune to share with one of our board members, Jane Wellehan. Together, we traipsed about the city by taxi, subway, bus, and foot. 
</p>
<p>
We hit the streets running with a day at the Under the Radar festival and four performances at the Public Theater. The <em>New York Times</em> recently featured the festival and many of the performances we saw on the cover of the “Arts” section, <a href="http://theater2.nytimes.com/2008/01/17/theater/reviews/17radar.html?scp=1&sq=under+the+radar&st=nyt" title="The NYT covers the Under the Radar festival.">still available online</a> if you missed it. 
<br />

</p><p>In a private studio listening session, way over on the West Side, where the only other businesses were car repair shops (yes, we did ask the taxi to wait while we made sure we had the correct address), Jane and I entered a non-descript building and went up many floors on a cramped elevator to hear clarinetist David Krakauer in a new project, Abraham, Inc., which featured among its many talented collaborators trombonist Fred Wesley and MC (and “beat architect”) So-Called. A sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall’s Zankel Hall in December 2006 marked the first step in this collaborative venture. The international tour will be launched later this spring with a concert at the Apollo Theater. 
</p>
<p>
One of the standouts was going to Williamsburg and choreographer Elizabeth Streb’s studio SLAM. Her athletic dancers propelled themselves through space, hitting the mats with such force as to elicit audible cries from many of us in the audience. Streb hosted Chicago’s 500 Clowns and the enchanting Strange Fruit from Australia, which featured dancers on 20-foot swaying poles. 
</p>
<p>
The Brasil Guitar Duo was a favorite at the showcase for young classical players. Unfortunately, I had to leave to get to another event before hearing the Parker String Quartet, touted as one of the young string quartets to watch. 
</p>
<p>
At Joe’s Pub, cellist Maya Baiser unveiled her new project, Provenance, which features a percussionist and oud player in a mesmerizing, sonic bridge that aims to span cultural and religious divides. 
</p>
<p>
While in New York, the <a href="http://www.limon.org/home.html">Limón Dance Company</a> celebrated founding choreographer José’s 100th birthday. Immediately following the NYC Centennial Gala, the company headed to Mexico City, where the festivities and honors continued. More on Limón and <a href="http://pcagreatperformances.org/2007-08/limon/" title="Limón Dance Company comes to PCA.">the upcoming PCA program</a> coming soon….
</p>
<p>
Over at the Blue Note, I caught the last set of the evening with Cuban jazz great Paquito D’Rivera and the Grammy Awarding-winning New York Voices, which features among its members Darmon Meader, who studied at <a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu/music/">USM’s School&nbsp;of&nbsp;Music</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And these are just a few of the highlights!
</p>
<p>
On the second to last day, there was threat of snow, which never happened but sent everyone into a tizzy and left me walking around the city in the rain wearing a long, wool coat. (Umbrellas are inconvenient.) Meanwhile, staff and family text-messaged from Maine telling me we were getting hit once again with <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=04101">another storm</a>. Flying back into Portland was a beautiful and welcome&nbsp;sight.&nbsp;

        <p>I love my job. I have the opportunity &#8220;to bravely go where no one has gone before&#8221; when I am thinking about education and outreach activities for PCA Great Performances.
</p>
<p>
When I was reading up on Moses Pendleton, founder and artistic director of Momix, and his piece <em>Lunar Sea,</em> I wanted to know more. I wondered if his inspiration for choosing the moon as the setting for the piece had something to do with his being influenced by the emerging USA space program when he was a child or watching <em>Star Trek.</em> Then I thought maybe he just liked gazing up at the moon and the stars while he was on his family&#8217;s farm in Vermont, or that he majored in astronomy at Dartmouth College.&nbsp; Those ponderings led me to ask the director of <a href="http://www.usm.maine.edu/planet/">USM&#8217;s Southworth Planetarium</a>, physics professor Dr. Jerry LaSala, about the moon and its seas.&nbsp; I wondered if there might be some correlation between the way scientists look at the moon and the way artists perceive it as an inspiration.
</p>
<p>
The result of all these ponderings and my incessant questions to both Dr. LaSala and Moses Pendleton is a collaboration between the USM Southworth Planetarium and PCA Great Performances. (You can hear Moses&#8217; responses to questions about <em>Lunar Sea</em> on <a href="http://pcagreatperformances.org/2007-08/momix/">our Momix page</a>.) <a href="http://pcagreatperformances.org/2007-08/momix/">&#8220;Journey to the Moon&#8217;s Lunar Seas,&#8221;</a> the pre-curtain lecture for <em>Lunar Sea,</em> will be held at an unusual location and time: at USM Southworth Planetarium, on Tuesday, January 22 from 7:30–8:30 pm (rather than in Merrill Auditorium immediately preceding the performance, as usual). The Momix dance company believes this is the first time any arts presenter has collaborated with a planetarium on behalf of <em>Lunar Sea.</em>
</p>
<p>
If you are a &#8220;lunatic&#8221; or someone who just loves gazing at the moon and wonders what dancing on the moon might be like, come journey with us to the Lunar Sea on Tuesday at Southworth Planetarium and on Thursday at Merrill Auditorium with Momix. Take a walk on the moon with PCA.

      <content type="html"><![CDATA[
        <p>While we ready ourselves to launch the new PCA blog, I am finalizing my schedule for the annual, national conference of the <a href="http://www.artspresenters.org/">Association of Performing Arts Presenters</a>. This conference brings more than four thousand delegates from around the world to New York City for a long weekend of showcases, full-length performances, festivals, seminars, workshops, and meetings with agents, artists and colleagues. It’s a heady and wonderfully exhausting experience!
<br />
 
<br />
With numerous showcases programmed for the conference and the cultural mecca of NYC as the setting, it’s an unparalled opportunity to see work that PCA might one day bring to Portland. While there I will get to see some of the events under discussion for 2008–09, preview a number of the early considerations for 2009–10, and discuss projects that are brewing for 2010 and beyond.
</p><p>I will visit the <a href="http://www.alvinailey.org/">Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater studios</a>, <a href="http://www.baryshnikovdancefoundation.org/bac.html">Baryshnikov Arts Center</a>, choreographer Elizabeth Streb’s studio SLAM, <a href="http://www.citycenter.org/">City Center</a>, and the <a href="http://www.japansociety.org/">Japan Society</a> to see dance performances. <a href="http://www.carnegiehall.org/">Carnegie Hall</a>’s Weill Recital Hall will host an evening of young classical artists – a wonderful chance to see the rising stars of tomorrow. PCA has a highly regarded reputation for identifying young virtuosos. (I am always excited to remind people that Yo-Yo Ma was 27 years old the first time PCA brought him to Portland!) The Under the Radar Festival, which annually promises provocative theater, is hosted by <a href="http://www.publictheater.org/">The Public Theater</a>, the famed venue founded by Joseph Papp, who brought “Shakespeare to the people” with the annual, free Shakespeare in the Park festival. The Public Theater is credited with launching forty-nine Broadway shows. Other events I’ll take in happen at Joe’s Pub – the live music venue at The Public – as well as at Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Jazz Standard, and <a href="http://www.nuyorican.org/">Nuyorican Poets Café</a>.
<br />
 
<br />
In addition to all of these performances and connecting with colleagues, I’m also looking forward to hearing a new report in advance of a soon-to-be released, much anticipated book co-edited by Bill Ivey (former chair of National Endowment for the Arts) and policy scholar Steven Tepper. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/041596041X/ref=cm_rna_own_wish_prod">Engaging Art: The Next Great Transformation of America&#8217;s Cultural Life</a></em> brings together social scientists and arts professionals to explore the driving forces that are affecting art and art-making in America – challenging old ways of thinking, raising probing questions, and examining how our communities engage with arts and culture today.
<br />
 
<br />
I look forward to sharing with you my discoveries when I return.
<br />

        <p>The unique nature of the upcoming PCA performance of <a href="../../../../../2007-08/momix/index.html"><em>Lunar Sea </em>by dancer-illusionists Momix</a> has necessitated special seating requirements for the Merrill Auditorium show on Thursday, January 24.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Momix&#8217;s &#8220;eye-popping and mind-boggling&#8221; (<em>New York Times</em>) new work <em>Lunar Sea</em> makes extensive use of black light to create extraordinary, surrealistic special effects as the dancers move about the Merrill stage. Because too much light in the theater could compromise these black-lit segments of the performance, PCA has arranged to have the theater&#8217;s aisle lights, which normally remain on during performances, extinguished for the full Momix show. As a consequence, audience members will be asked to remain seated for their own safety throughout the entire <em>Lunar Sea </em>performance, which will last 90 minutes with no intermission.
<br />
</p>
<p>
Concerned about spending an hour and a half in your seat while you take in the full, mind-blowing Momix experience? Fear not! Having previewed this stunning new work, I promise you&#8217;ll be both riveted to your seat <em>and</em> transported to other worlds, captivated by the spellbinding interplay of light, music, and motion that is <em>Lunar&nbsp;Sea</em>. Enjoy!
<br />
