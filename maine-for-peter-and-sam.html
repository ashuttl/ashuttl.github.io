<p class="p1">Maine’s great. The coast is beautiful, it’s uncrowded and unhurried, and it has more interesting culture than a place of its population probably deserves. You’re right to focus on greater Portland and what’s called Downeast — that is, the middle coast from Bath to Bar Harbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">I’d spend a couple of days around Portland, then drive up the coast. When you’re heading north, take the highway (I-295, not the Maine Turnpike) out of Portland, and get off in Brunswick to follow coastal Route One. It’ll take you longer to get to Acadia, but it’s a much more pleasant drive, and there are some towns on the way you’ll be glad not to have missed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Note that in addition to my scattered notes here, the <i>New York Times</i> website has surprisingly good recommendations for what to do in Maine. Check out “<a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/travel/22hours.html?pagewanted=all">36 Hours in Portland, Me.</a>” and their sections on <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/maine/deer-isle/overview.html?pagewanted=all">Deer Isle</a>, <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/maine/mount-desert-island/overview.html?pagewanted=all">Mount Desert Island</a>, and <a href="http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/north-america/united-states/maine/penobscot-bay/camden/overview.html?pagewanted=all">Camden</a>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>Portland</b></p>
<p class="p1">Portland is the Big City of my youth, if you can believe that, although the population is roughly equal to that of the 10023 ZIP code. It’s a funny mix of working waterfront, edgy arts scene, and still-wound-too-tight émigrés from Boston and New York (<i>cough</i> Alice <i>cough</i>hauser). It’s also home to some of the best restaurants in New England. Do your strolling and shopping, if that’s your thing, on <b>Exchange</b>, <b>Middle</b>, <b>Congress</b>, and <b>Commercial Streets</b>, and around <b>Monument Square</b>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Culture</b></p>
<p class="p1">If you’re there on the first Friday night of the month, check out the <a href="http://www.firstfridayartwalk.com/"><b>First Friday Art Walk</b></a>. Artists of all types open their studios to the public, and usually a few hundred people walk around seeing what everyone’s got on offer.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The I.M. Pei–designed <b>Portland Museum of Art </b>on Congress Street is excellent and well worth a visit. President Obama ate there last night. They have a Degas exhibition on right now, and their permanent collection includes a few Edward Hoppers and Winslow Homers that are Maine through and through. I’ve also heard interesting things about the nearby <b>Museum of African Culture</b>, although I haven’t personally visited it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You two might also enjoy <b>Carlson &amp; Turner Antiquarian Books </b>at 241 Congress Street. It’s a sleepy little rare-books store that always has some interesting finds. The owner, Scott Wilson, runs a working letterpress and bindery shop out of the basement. My first apartment was upstairs, so if you see Scott, tell him I say hello.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Food and Drink</b></p>
<p class="p1">For a nice dinner, the deserved king of Portland’s restaurant scene is <a href="http://www.forestreet.biz/"><b>Fore Street</b></a>. The cuisine is nothing too far out of the ordinary, but it’s exquisitely prepared in an open wood-fired kitchen from locally sourced ingredients, and the service is usually outstanding. If you can’t get a reservation, they save a huge portion of the restaurant for walk-ins, so drop by early in the evening and ask to be put on the list. Another great choice is <b>Five Fifty-Five</b>, at 555 Congress Street, where I tended bar for years; the owner used to run the kitchen at the French Laundry in California. If you want a steak, you can’t go wrong with <b>The Grill Room</b> on Exchange Street, and for brunch, its sister restaurant <b>The Front Room</b> on Munjoy Hill is a winner. People also seem to enjoy <b>Grace</b>, in a converted church across Chestnut Street from my high school, and <b>Caiolas</b> on the West End is a terrific neighborhood restaurant whose number is still saved in my phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">For a more casual feel, you might like the Spanish-inspired <b>Local 188</b> or its new downtown cousin, <b>Sonny’s</b>, which is in a very old bank building and has an interesting and smart cocktail menu. The <b>Great Lost Bear</b> on Forest Avenue is a landmark pub with a giant food menu and one of the country’s largest selections of draught beer, often with 100+ beers on tap. <b>Novare Res</b> on Exchange Street is a great newish Belgian-style beer garden that I know Alice frequents. The eclectic, vegan-friendly <b>Sillys</b> on Washington Avenue is a low-key favorite. On the foreign side, there are a few unusual options run by Portland’s oddly massive immigrant community, including a truly wonderful, if dumpy-looking, Eritrean-Ethiopian place on Oak Street called <b>Asmara</b>. And there are many more great options.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Outdoors</b></p>
<p class="p1">If the weather’s nice, you’ll want to get outside. Check out <b>Deering Oaks</b>, a public park that was Frederick Law Olmsted’s dress rehearsal for New York’s Central Park. Have a leisurely walk through the brick-and-tree-filled <b>West End</b> and the historic <b>Western Promenade</b>, which features some wonderful architecture, including the palatial tile-roofed West Mansion. Explore the working <b>piers along Commercial Street</b>. And stroll along the <b>Eastern Promenade </b>and through <b>Fort Allen Park</b> for great views of the island-studded Casco Bay.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Speaking of Casco Bay, consider taking <a href="http://www.cascobaylines.com/">the ferry</a> to <b>Peaks Island</b> for the day: it’s a beautiful walk or bike ride around the island (bikes can be rented on the cheap once you’re out there, on Island Avenue, up the hill and to the left when you get off the ferry); the far side faces open ocean and is a stunning place for a picnic if it’s warm. I challenge you to resist the temptation to buy dirt-cheap real estate out there. To the north, other great places to see the ocean include <b>Mackworth Island</b>, home to the scenic Baxter School for the Deaf, just over the Route One bridge into Falmouth, and the historic <b>Wolfe’s Neck Farm</b> in Freeport, a lovely walk and the organic grass-fed beef provider for self-respecting New York City restaurants. To the south, there’s <b>Fort Williams Park</b> and the famous <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=portland%20head%20light&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=p0d3T4nFBPSF0QHhwNS3DQ&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=803&amp;sei=qEd3T9qvFIfc0QGJssiODQ"><b>Portland Head Light</b></a>, and <b>Two Lights State Park</b>, where Edward Hopper painted <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/489258">this</a>, and where you can enjoy a lobster on a picnic table at the perennial favorite <b>The Lobster Shack</b>. Also look for nearby <b>Kettle Cove State Park </b>and <b>Crescent Beach</b>, where I used to go look at the ocean whenever I had a bad day at work.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Along Forest Avenue/Route 302, there’s a rare chance to enjoy a dying bit of Americana: two great <b>drive-in movie theaters</b>, one at Prides Corner and the other in Bridgton.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Where to Stay</b></p>
<p class="p1">In town, if you want B&amp;B-style accommodations, the <b>Pomegranate Inn</b> is a great choice. For a proper hotel, the <b>Regency</b> on Milk Street is the classic, and the <b>Hilton Garden Inn</b> on Commercial Street and the <b>Portland Harbor Hotel</b> on Temple Street are shiny, new, and reliable. Skip the once-great Eastland Hotel, I’m sad to say. There are many nice options in the surrounding coastal towns, too.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>The Coast</b></p>
<p class="p1">On your drive, you’ll pass through some lovely towns: <b>Bath</b>, a lovely shipbuilding town where my father used to be schools superintendent; <b>Boothbay Harbor</b>, if you choose to venture out of your way to the charming real-life inspiration for <i>Murder, She Wrote</i>’s fictional Cabot Cove; the gorgeous <b>Rockland-Rockport-Camden</b> region; <b>Belfast</b>, a mini-city that’s worth exploring on foot for a bit — stop by the <b>Co-op </b>natural foods store for a provisions and a taste of Maine’s survivalist hippie culture; and finally historic little <b>Searsport</b>. On the Belfast-Searsport-Bucksport stretch of Route One, keep your eyes open for interesting roadside shops, and stop by <b>Main and State Streets in Ellsworth</b>, the region’s hub and my childhood summer home (“camp” to the initiated).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Once Downeast, I suggest exploring one of two general regions: Mount Desert Island or Deer Isle. You’re probably not there long enough to do both.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Mount Desert Island</b></p>
<p class="p1">This is the traditional choice and it’s a good one. There’s a lot to see and do, and in May, it won’t be touristy yet — it’s the perfect time to visit. Pro tip: <i>Desert</i> here is French, not English; pronounce it “dizz-URT,” like “dessert,” or just call it “MDI.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">MDI is about three times the size of Manhattan, making it the largest island on the East Coast after Long Island. It’s the beautiful home to <b>Acadia National Park</b>; <b>Cadillac Mountain</b>, composed of rare pink granite, where you can drive to the summit; touristy <b>Bar Harbor</b>; and the more upscale, less touristy towns of <b>Southwest </b>and <b>Northeast Harbors</b>, on either side of stunning <b>Somes Sound</b>, the only fjord on the East Coast. Jane Moss has a family home in Southwest Harbor; Martha Stewart has a home in nearby <b>Seal Harbor</b>. There is great shopping and antiquing throughout the island. There’s also a healthy supply of artist-run galleries, although some may still be closed for the season when you’re there.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">On your way out to MDI, on Route Three just past Ellsworth, stop by a supermarket or gas station for a copy of the <b><i>Ellsworth American</i></b> newspaper to see if there are any art fairs or other special events while you’re there — there’s always something. A little way farther out on Route Three, in <b>Trenton</b>, stop by one of the roadside lobster restaurants for a low-key meal of lobster, “steamers,” and blueberry beer. You’ll recognize these places by the giant steaming lobster pots outside.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To get away from whatever tourists <i>are</i> there, be sure to walk the Acadia National Park <b>Carriage Paths</b> for nature — I swear, you have never breathed fresher air in your life than you will here — and the <b>John D. Rockefeller, Jr. House</b> for architecture and history. Also consider renting motor scooters from <b>Acadia Outfitters</b> on Cottage Street in Bar Harbor; they’re a surprisingly fun and panoramic way to ride the beautiful <b>Park Loop Road</b> and to the top of Cadillac, and the automotive traffic is usually sparse enough to make it not too nerve-racking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Don’t go on a whale watch. You are virtually guaranteed to vomit from seasickness instead of seeing a whale.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Whatever you do, do <i>not</i> skip <b>The Burning Tree</b>, a hidden gem of a restaurant along Otter Creek Drive in the center of the island. Many also enjoy beautiful <b>Jordan Pond</b> and the Jordan Pond House<b> </b>restaurant, located on National Park Service land, although the main appeal of the restaurant there is the gluten-filled popovers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Deer Isle</b></p>
<p class="p1">This is the less developed, more adventurous choice. It’s gorgeous and deeply relaxing, but you’ll find less to do and less of an establishment to help you do it. For that reason, it might be a better choice for your second trip to Maine; for this trip, I recommend you enjoy the activity and comfort of Mount Desert Island, but I include this here because you mentioned getting off the beaten path.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">From downtown Ellsworth, take Route 172 towards Surry and then Blue Hill. <b>Downtown Blue Hill</b>, once upon a time the source of the pristine granite used in the Brooklyn Bridge, is beautiful and historic and worth at least an hour, but it’s more filled with New Yorkers than it used to be, so we’re going to press on. Take the long way on Route 175 so you can swing through <b>Brooklin</b>, the little town to which the great E.B. White retired after he left New York, then pass through Sedgwick and Sargentville on your way to the vertiginously narrow suspension bridge that will take you to the pair of islands together known as <b>Deer Isle</b>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Deer Isle is still largely undiscovered and the natural beauty here is striking. The people are mostly working-class born-and-bred Mainers, many of them fishermen, with an increasing community of artists (you’ll find more galleries than you’ll have time to stop at), plus a tiny contingent of wealthy ex–New Yorkers.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Once on the island, I suggest taking Route 15 until the sign that says to turn right towards Sunset and West Stonington. This will take you around the island the scenic back way, along Route 15A (first called Sunset’s Main Street, then Sunset Road, then Burnt Cove Road) into <b>Sunset</b> and finally <b>Stonington</b>, the largest community on the island. Stonington is perched on a couple of streets that run parallel to the exquisitely beautiful harbor. There are a handful of little restaurants, a few shops, a great antique-book store, and a few B&amp;B-style hotels, of which <a href="http://www.presduport.com/"><b>Près du Port</b></a><b> </b>is probably the best choice. There’s also the <a href="http://www.operahousearts.org/"><b>Stonington Opera House</b></a>, the name of which is not at all an exaggeration; it’s a year-round performing arts and community center programmed in part by, I kid you not, Erica Zielinski.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">If you go to Stonington and the weather’s nice, consider taking <a href="http://www.isleauhaut.com/"><b>the mail boat</b></a> out to <b>Isle au Haut </b>(rhymes with “Idaho”), a gorgeous and very rustic island that’s home to a small community, a four-room “inn,” and (though this is a surprise even to many native Mainers) a beautiful, remote, off-MDI corner of Acadia National Park.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
