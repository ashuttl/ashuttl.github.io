> In formal contexts, avoid splitting infinitives.
>
> The rule against split infinitives is antiquated and perhaps even a little wrongheaded. It seems to stem from a belief that Latin is the purest language, and because Latin infinitives are one word and cannot be split, English infinitives should not be split, either.
>
> The authoritative texts generally approve of split infinitives, and have done so for a while: the Chicago Manual has found split infinitives acceptable since the 13th edition in 1983, and Strunk and White provisionally endorsed the practice as early as 1959.
>
> That said, our goal with all matters of style should be unobtrusiveness; we should call as little attention to these decisions as possible. Because split infinitives are jarring to many careful readers despite all the above, avoid them where there is a graceful alternative. Where a split is unavoidable (or even elegant), accept it.

This whole thing has been a labor of love.
