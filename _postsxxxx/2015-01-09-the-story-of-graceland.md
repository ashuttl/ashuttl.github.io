The special 25th anniversary edition of _Graceland_, one of my all-time favorite albums, has a fascinating ten-minute piece where Paul Simon describes the process of writing the title track. Well worth a listen for his process and also to hear the musical components added one by one. Play it below in Spotify or click the headline link to find the track in iTunes.
