According to WNYC's _Studio 360_, via [Mark Ho-Kane](http://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=markhokane):

> In 1976, Philip Glass was an unknown composer – almost pushing 40, and driving a taxi to make ends meet – when he got his break: a new work performed at New York’s echt-prestigious Metropolitan Opera House.

_Einstein on the Beach_ was composed by a New York City taxi driver. That completely blows my mind.

Also, as someone who got an early start and then watched as everyone caught up with me, I'm always encouraged by those who become wildly successful rather late in life. Maybe there’s hope for me to make a comeback.
