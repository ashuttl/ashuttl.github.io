Richard Rockefeller was killed in a plane crash yesterday morning. He was my pediatrician all through my childhood and one of the kindest people I’ve ever met.

My mother tells me he first examined me when I was about one hour old. Apparently he told her then, “Cheryl, you are going to have the trials and joys of a child who is extremely alert to this world.”

I haven’t seen Dr. Rockefeller for years. Lincoln Center was founded by his uncle John. I wish I had had the chance to tell him I worked here.
