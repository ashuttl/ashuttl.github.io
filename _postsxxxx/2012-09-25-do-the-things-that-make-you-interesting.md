>Our minds have a depth of field, much like the lens on a camera. When we think about one thing, everything else becomes unclear or temporarily “forgotten.” To pay attention to a thing means we must ignore everything else, if only briefly.

Living in New York City, constantly surrounded by so much of every imaginable type of stimulation, I have never felt less connected to reality or to myself. It’s especially obvious having just spent a weekend in my home state of Maine. New York is at most a temporary home for me, and this piece gets at exactly why.
